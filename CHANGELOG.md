### Breaking Changes
- ```frontend_parent_controller``` config variable now expects a string rather than a Class
- Should `display: none` on swiper next and previous buttons if they are not required
- All existing images need there versions created.
```
Integral::Image.find_each do |image|
  image.file.recreate_versions!
end
```
- Integral.configuration.listable_objects no longer exists. To register an object as listable the model should call acts_as_listable and implement #to_list_item and .listable_options.
